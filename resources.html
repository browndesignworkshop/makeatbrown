There are many ways to get involved with making at Brown, and they vary a bit by space.

For the Brown Design Workshop and Rock Digital Studio, the easiest way to get to know the resources and spaces is to simply visit during (monitored) open hours.

For the Media Lab family, we recommend emailing mml@brown.edu and attending a workshop.

For Tockwotton, VISA Sculpture, and the JEPIS Student Shop, we recommend taking classes for access (with Richard Fishman, sculpture in VISA, or ENGN0260, respectively).
